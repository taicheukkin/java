### Running the Program in IntelliJ


#### Using toolbar run button or keyboard shortcuts  
#### Viewing output in terminal window  

## 6. Java Compilation and Execution Process

### Compilation Step


#### Using javac compiler to convert source code to bytecode  

#### Generating .class files from .java files  

###  Execution Step

#### Java Virtual Machine (JVM) role in running bytecode  
####  JVM translating bytecode to native OS code  
#### Platform independence of Java applications  

### Running Java Programs Manually

####  Using terminal or command prompt to compile and run  
#### Specifying full package path when running JVM  

## 7. Interesting Facts About Java

### History and Naming

#### Developed by James Gosling in 1995 at Sun Microsystems  
####  Original names: Oak, Green, then Java inspired by coffee  

### Java Editions
