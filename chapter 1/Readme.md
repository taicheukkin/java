# Summary of "Mosh Java Tutorial - Part 1: Fundamentals"

## 1. Introduction
- This tutorial teaches downloading and installing the necessary tools for Java development, specifically the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** and **IntelliJ IDEA**.

## 2. Installing JDK and IntelliJ IDEA
- **JDK**: A software development environment for building Java applications, including a compiler and the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**.
- Download JDK from Oracle's website, accept the license agreement, and install it.
- Recommended code editor: **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**.

## 3. Anatomy of a Java Program
- **Functions (Methods)**: Blocks of code that perform specific tasks, defined with a return type, name, and parameters.
  - The main method is the entry point of every Java program.
  
- **Classes**: Containers for related functions, organizing code logically.
  - Every Java program must have at least one class that contains the main method.

## 4. Creating and Running Your First Java Project
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and create a new project.
2. Select Java as the project type and ensure the JDK is selected.
3. Create a command-line application and name it (e.g., "hello world").
4. Define a base package (e.g., `com.codewithmosh`).
5. Write code in the main method to print "Hello World".

## 5. Code Execution Process
- **Compilation**: The Java compiler converts source code (.java) into bytecode (.class).
- **Execution**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) translates bytecode into native machine code.

## 6. Interesting Facts About Java
- Developed by James Gosling in 1995; originally called Oak.
- Four editions: **Standard Edition (SE)**, **Enterprise Edition (EE)**, **Micro Edition (ME)**, and **JavaCard**.
- Java runs on billions of devices and has a large developer community (~9 million).

## 7. Course Structure Overview
- The course is divided into parts, focusing on:
  - **Part 1**: Java fundamentals.
  - **Part 2**: Type system and building a mortgage calculator.
  - **Part 3**: Control flow statements and data validation.
  - **Part 4**: Clean coding practices and debugging.

The tutorial provides a comprehensive foundation for learning Java programming.
